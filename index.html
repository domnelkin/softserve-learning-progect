    <h1>Manchester united</h1>
    <div>
        <p class="aboutTeam">Manchester was one of the fastest growing cities during the Industrial Revolution and much so due to a torrent of workers arriving from different parts of the British Islands. From a relatively small town in the beginning of the 19th century, Manchester had passed one million inhabits by 1900 and had become one of the biggest cities in Europe. It was great conditions for football clubs to emerge; the sport was after all, in its early history to a big degree dominated by workers. The club that later would become Manchester United FC was initially founded in the year 1878, named as Newton Heath L&YR Football Club. L&YR as in Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, which were the company there the team's player worked.

            The team played in the Football League for the very first time in 1892 (they should not be confused with Manchester Football Club, founded in 1860 and participated in the FA Cup in the 1870s before shifting to Rugby). But, they were relegated after two years. Next, a new group of local businessmen then took over the roles and responsibilities of the club and named it as Manchester United in 1902. The newly named club won the title of English League in 1908 under the guidance of Ernest Mangnall. The first FA Cup trophy was obtained the following year. The team then shifted to the current stadium, Old Trafford in 1910.
            
            After the Second World War, the club had witnessed an extended spell with the appointment of Matt Busby in 1945. This visionary leader completely reshaped the club and placed a new faith in youngsters, and this strategy eventually proved to be astonishingly successful.
            
            The United team would win the league in 1955–56 and 1956–57. The average age were 21 at the first occasion, which made it the youngest side ever to win the Football League and earned them the nickname the “Busby Babes”.
            
            The plane crash
            One day in 1958 is especially marked in dark colors for the in the history of Manchester United. After a game against Red Star Belgrade in European Cup the United team was flying back to England then disaster struck. After a refuel in Munich the plane crash at the start and eight players and three members of the staff died. But the coach survived the plane crash and he eventually built another great side that won many championship trophies and witnessed poignant victories over the time.</p>
